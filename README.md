abstract:  
This project aims to provide alternative and innovative plan models for booming cities that are currently under rapid development. Using digital technology, we strive to integrate the diverse local structure in socialand spatial aspects with the ambition and demands of cityâ€™s expansion. Firstly, though parameterization, the local infrastructure, industry chain and living patterns were diagrammatized, quantized and input as reference database. Secondly, digital sequence simulation is used as an innovative tool to promote interventions among above elements and generate emergent process of living activities which interact to each other base on cellular automata theory. Finally, building behaviors of this area were predicted and outputted possible master plan indesirable future. This study arrives at an open scenario the feasible prospect. A conclusion is drawn to reflect the process, achievement and weakness of the research.

The final thesis of Haidong Ma "Macro Thinking and Micro Action" aims to provide alternative urban strategies for currently developing Chinese cities. He proposes the use of digital technologies to assess diverse local structures and to combine them with the social and spatial requirements of rapid city expansion.

Mr. Ma developed a custom tool to evaluate, store, and represent a series of infrastructures, and living patterns. in a second step a digital sequence simulation, based on cellular automata processes, was generated to analyse interventions among the reference elements and to produce sequences of living activities. Finally a prediction for building behavior and a possible master plan were exported by the software.

Haidong Ma presented his tool as part of the eCAADe 2010 conference and was awarded one of the ten best papers. His thesis demonstrated both a very creative approach as well as a particularly high technical competency.
